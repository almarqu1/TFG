Job Description

Target PR Range: 40-60/hr

Depending one experience

Seeking a highly motivated and driven data scientist to join our Quantitative, Translational & ADME Sciences (QTAS) team in North Chicago, IL. The QTAS organization supports the discovery and early clinical pipeline through mechanistically investigating how drug molecules are absorbed, distributed, excreted, metabolized, and transported across the body to predict duration and intensity of exposure and pharmacological action of drug candidates in humans. Digital workflows, systems, IT infrastructure, and computational sciences are critical and growing components within the organization to help deliver vital results in the early pipeline. This specific job role is designed to act as an SME (subject matter expert) for data science within the technical organization of QTAS.

For this role, the successful candidate will have a substantial background in data and computer science with an emphasis on supporting, developing and implementing IT solutions for lab-based systems as well as utilizing computational methods. The candidate should possess a deep knowledge in AI/ML, with a focus on both supervised (like neural networks, decision trees) and unsupervised learning techniques (such as clustering, PCA). They must be adept at applying these methods to large datasets for predictive modeling; in this context- drug properties and discovery patterns in ADME datasets. Proficiency in model validation, optimization, and feature engineering is essential to ensure accuracy and robustness in predictions. The role requires effective collaboration with interdisciplinary teams to integrate AI insights into drug development processes. Strong communication skills are necessary to convey complex AI/ML concepts to a diverse audience.

Key Responsibilities

 Provide business-centric support of IT systems and platforms in support of our scientific operations and processes. Develop, implement, troubleshoot and support solutions independently for the digital infrastructure and workflows within QTAS including custom platform/coding solutions, visualization tools, integration of new software/hardware, and analysis and troubleshooting support. Lead the analysis of large ADME-related datasets, contributing to the understanding and optimization of drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion properties. Apply computational tools and machine learning/deep learning techniques to analyze and interpret complex biological data relevant to drug discovery. Develop predictive models and algorithms for identifying potential drug candidates with desirable ADME properties. Collaborate with teams across biological sciences and drug discovery to integrate computational insights into practical drug development strategies. Communicate findings and strategic input to cross-functional teams, including Translational Science, Medicine, and Late Development groups.

Qualifications

Title: Undergraduate Student Researcher
Experience Level: nan
Work Type: Internship

--- DESCRIPTION ---
Applications must be submitted to Tiffany Stone Wolbrecht at twolbrecht@aui.edu. Please do not apply via LinkedIn.
AUI and the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill (UNC-Chapel Hill) are currently seeking undergraduate students to contribute to cutting-edge research in astronomy education. This paid opportunity, open to education and STEM majors, explores the impacts of new curriculum centered on the use of robotic telescopes, and is made possible through U.S. National Science Foundation funding. The program, consisting of approximately 360 primarily flexible workhours, runs from June 2024 through January 2025. This research experience is hybrid and features travel allowance for activities including an in-person field training at the Green Bank Observatory on June 9-15. Applications are due Sunday, May 5, 2024.
“Specifically, the research will focus on understanding how pedagogical methods and collaborative approaches impact student outcomes in astronomy education” said Dan Reichart, professor of physics and astronomy at the UNC-Chapel Hill and director of the Skynet Robotic Telescope Network. “What we are really looking for are students active in STEM or educational fields, with a strong academic record and interest in research. In turn, participants will have an opportunity to be mentored, work with an international team, travel to data collection sites and help present research findings at a professional conference.”
Travel will be funded through an allowance and the students will be supported with a $4,000 stipend.
“This is a wonderful introduction into education research,” said Tiffany Stone Wolbrecht, AUI’s interim director for education and public engagement. “The selected students will gain valuable experience in observational data analysis, research methods, collaborating on an international research team, and may even have the opportunity to publish outcomes beyond the program.”
The experience is part of a Research Experience for Undergraduate (REU) program and focuses on exploring STEM attitudes, self-efficacy and career intentions in introductory astronomy courses. The selected REU students will play a crucial role in investigating emerging trends in STEM education through a case study approach. They will collect observational and interview data, analyze existing survey data and collaborate with our research team to uncover insights into student learning experiences.
To apply, U.S. citizens and permanent residents that are currently enrolled in an undergraduate degree program should submit a current resume or CV, a statement of interest outlining their motivation for participating in the REU program and relevant experience (max 500 words), and preferably two letters of recommendation to Tiffany Stone Wolbrecht at twolbrecht@aui.edu.
We believe that diversity strengthens our research community and enriches the educational experience for everyone involved. We are committed to fostering an inclusive environment where all individuals, including women, people of color, LGBTQ+ individuals, individuals with disabilities, and first-generation college students feel welcome and valued. We actively encourage applications from students from these underrepresented groups.
