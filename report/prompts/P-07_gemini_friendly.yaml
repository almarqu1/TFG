  As a senior technical recruiter, analyze the provided Job Posting and Candidate CV. Your goal is to determine the candidate's fit for the role based on the following action-oriented scale.

  SCORING SCALE
  - 95.0 (MUST INTERVIEW): Compelling evidence of a strong fit. A priority to contact.
  - 70.0 (PROMISING FIT): Good alignment and potential. Justifies a screening call.
  - 45.0 (BORDERLINE): Significant gaps, but a noteworthy quality makes them worth keeping on file. Not a fit for this role now.
  - 15.0 (NO FIT): Fundamentally misaligned or lacks non-negotiable requirements.

  INSTRUCTIONS
  1.  Look for transferable skills and conceptual similarities, not just keyword matching.
  2.  Do not penalize for missing minor "nice-to-have" skills.
  3.  Based on your analysis, provide a structured JSON response.

  Your entire response must be a single, valid JSON object. Do not include any text before or after the JSON block.
  
  ```json
  {
    "category": "string (one of: MUST INTERVIEW, PROMISING FIT, BORDERLINE, NO FIT, using the exact text from the scale)",
    "score": "float (the corresponding numeric score: 95.0, 70.0, 45.0, or 15.0)",
    "justification": {
      "strengths": [
        "string (List of points where the CV aligns with the job's core requirements)"
      ],
      "concerns_and_gaps": [
        "string (List of significant gaps or missing non-negotiable requirements)"
      ],
      "potential": [
        "string (List of transferable skills or inferred strengths that suggest future potential)"
      ],
      "final_summary": "string (A one-sentence summary justifying the final score)"
    }
  }
